The use of statistical models in computer algorithms allows computers to make decisions and predictions, and to perform tasks that traditionally require human cognitive abilities. Machine learning is the interdisciplinary field at the intersection of statistics and computer science which develops such algorithms and interweaves them with computer systems. It underpins many modern technologies, such as speech recognition, internet search, bioinformatics, computer vision, Amazon’s recommender system, Google’s driverless car and the most recent imaging systems for cancer diagnosis are all based on Machine Learning technology.

This course on Time Series Analysis, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing will explain how to build systems that learn and adapt using real-world applications. Some of the topics to be covered include time series analysis, machine learning, python data analysis, natural language processing models and recurrent models. The course will be project-oriented, with emphasis placed on writing software implementations of learning algorithms applied to real-world problems, in particular, churn modeling, natural language processing, sentiment detection, among others.
